      title: "Development & Application of Solid Solid-PCM for Thermal Management of Electronics.",
      subtitle:"Dr. Sandip K. Saha, Professor, IIT Bombay",
      content: `The project aims to develop a novel solid-solid phase change material for the spacecraft cooling system with the stability of PCM of more than 1000 thermal cycles. Second, to determine the optimum percentage of thermal conductivity enhancer. Third, to develop a reliable and optimally sized hybrid (SS-PCM and heat pipe) honeycomb panel for better isothermalization of the electronics chips at 35-45°C. Fourth, to develop a detailed numerical model of solid-solid phase change material to assess the dynamic melting behaviour. Fifth, to develop an experimental setup consisting of solid-solid PCM and heat pipe in a honeycomb panel, and last, to characterize the thermal performance of honeycomb panels experimentally under continuous and cyclic loading. To evaluate the efficacy of SS-PCM in comparison with solid-liquid (SL)-PCM. For more details, go through the attached write-up.
